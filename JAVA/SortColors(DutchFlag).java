/*Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function*/

/*
In this approach, we will be using 3 pointers named low, mid, and high. We will be using these 3 pointers to move around the values. The primary goal here is to move 0s to the left and 2s to the right of the array and at the same time all the 1s shall be in the middle region of the array and hence the array will be sorted.
